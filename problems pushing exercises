For the past few days, I've been denied pushing exercises to the branch.

I get the following error:

"ERROR: Permission to TheOdinProject/css-exercises.git denied to Shimazaky80.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists."

I was pushing tasks before, but I can't anymore. I checked all my keys, which are both linked to Github.

Anybody willing to help with a fix?

I will appreciate it.

Regards;

Jose
